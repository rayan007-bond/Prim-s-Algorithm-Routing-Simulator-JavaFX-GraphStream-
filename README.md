# Prim's Algorithm Routing Simulator (JavaFX + GraphStream)
A modern, interactive JavaFX simulator for visualizing Prim's Algorithm step-by-step with GraphStream.

(Example: Prim's Algorithm in action)

# Key Features
✔ Interactive Graph Editor – Add nodes/edges, set weights, and reset the canvas.
✔ Step-by-Step Visualization – Pause, play, or adjust animation speed.
✔ Smart Edge Highlighting – Colors indicate MST edges, considered, and skipped edges.
✔ Real-Time Logging – Detailed console output for algorithm tracing.
✔ Random Graph Generator – Quick-start simulations with weighted graphs.

# What is Prim’s Algorithm?
Prim's Algorithm is a greedy method to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph:

### Starts at an arbitrary node.

### Grows the MST by adding the cheapest edge connecting the tree to a new node.

### Repeats until all nodes are included.

### Time Complexity: O(E log V) (with a priority queue).
