# 🌐 Prim's Algorithm Routing Simulator (JavaFX + GraphStream)

This project is a **JavaFX-based graphical simulator** for **Prim’s Algorithm**, a classic greedy algorithm used to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected weighted graph.

It allows users to **build, visualize, and simulate** Prim’s algorithm **step-by-step** with a modern and interactive GUI powered by **GraphStream** and **JavaFX**.

## 🧠 What is Prim’s Algorithm?

**Prim's Algorithm** is a greedy algorithm used to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, weighted graph. It works as follows:

- ✅ **Starts from a source node**
- 🔁 **Repeatedly adds the lowest-weight edge** that connects a new node to the MST
- 🛑 **Stops when all nodes are included** in the MST

This simulator helps visualize this step-by-step with **animations**, **color-coded edges**, and a **log window** to observe the algorithm's progress.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add custom nodes and edges with weights.
- ✅ Automatically generate random graphs.
- ✅ Visualize each step of Prim's Algorithm.
- ✅ Real-time edge highlighting (`MST`, `considered`, `skipped`).
- ✅ Adjustable speed control & step-by-step mode.
- ✅ Logger window for detailed algorithm progress.
- ✅ Smooth JavaFX and GraphStream-based visualization.
